Documentation : https://flama.perdy.io Flama \u00b6 Flama aims to bring a layer on top of Starlette to provide an easy to learn and fast to develop approach for building highly performant GraphQL and REST APIs. In the same way of Starlette is, Flama is a perfect option for developing asynchronous and production-ready services. Among other characteristics it provides the following: Generic classes for API resources that provides standard CRUD methods over SQLAlchemy tables. Schema system based on Marshmallow that allows to declare the inputs and outputs of endpoints and provides a reliable way of validate data against those schemas. Dependency Injection that ease the process of managing parameters needed in endpoints. Flama ASGI objects like Request , Response , Session and so on are defined as components and ready to be injected in your endpoints. Components as the base of the plugin ecosystem, allowing you to create custom or use those already defined in your endpoints, injected as parameters. Auto generated API schema using OpenAPI standard. It uses the schema system of your endpoints to extract all the necessary information to generate your API Schema. Auto generated docs providing a Swagger UI or ReDoc endpoint. Pagination automatically handled using multiple methods such as limit and offset, page numbers... Requirements \u00b6 Python 3.6+ Starlette 0.12.0+ Marshmallow 3.0.0rc6+ Installation \u00b6 $ pip install flama Example \u00b6 from marshmallow import Schema , fields , validate from flama.applications import Flama # Data Schema class Puppy ( Schema ): id = fields . Integer () name = fields . String () age = fields . Integer ( validate = validate . Range ( min = 0 )) # Database puppies = [ { \"id\" : 1 , \"name\" : \"Canna\" , \"age\" : 6 }, { \"id\" : 2 , \"name\" : \"Sandy\" , \"age\" : 12 }, ] # Application app = Flama ( components = [], # Without custom components title = \"Foo\" , # API title version = \"0.1\" , # API version description = \"Bar\" , # API description schema = \"/schema/\" , # Path to expose OpenAPI schema docs = \"/docs/\" , # Path to expose Swagger UI docs redoc = \"/redoc/\" , # Path to expose ReDoc docs ) # Views @app.route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"GET\" ]) def list_puppies ( name : str = None ) -> Puppy ( many = True ): \"\"\" description: List the puppies collection. There is an optional query parameter that specifies a name for filtering the collection based on it. responses: 200: description: List puppies. \"\"\" return [ puppy for puppy in puppies if puppy [ \"name\" ] == name ] @app.route ( \"/\" , methods = [ \"POST\" ]) def create_puppy ( puppy : Puppy ) -> Puppy : \"\"\" description: Create a new puppy using data validated from request body and add it to the collection. responses: 200: description: Puppy created successfully. \"\"\" puppies . append ( puppy ) return puppy Dependencies \u00b6 Following Starlette philosophy Flama reduce the number of hard dependencies to those that are used as the core: starlette - Flama is a layer on top of it. marshmallow - Flama data schemas and validation. It does not have any more hard dependencies, but some of them are necessaries to use some features: pyyaml - Required for API Schema and Docs auto generation. apispec - Required for API Schema and Docs auto generation. python-forge - Required for pagination. sqlalchemy - Required for Generic API resources. databases - Required for Generic API resources. You can install all of these with pip3 install flama[full] . Credits \u00b6 That library is heavily inspired by APIStar server in an attempt to bring a good amount of it essence to work with Starlette as the ASGI framework and Marshmallow as the schema system. Contributing \u00b6 This project is absolutely open to contributions so if you have a nice idea, create an issue to let the community discuss it.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#flama","text":"Flama aims to bring a layer on top of Starlette to provide an easy to learn and fast to develop approach for building highly performant GraphQL and REST APIs.
